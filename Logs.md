# 100 Days of ML Code Log

## Day 0: Oct 30, 2018 

**Progress**: Setting up Git repo, and reading about others who have embarked on this path

## Day 1: Oct 31, 2018

**Progress**: Linear Regression assumptions and their validation
1. Linear relation between features and the dependant variable: Complete
2. Homoscedasticity of error terms: Complete
3. Uncorrelated error terms
4. Independant features

Started: Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques (Problem #1)

## Day 3: Nov 2, 2018

**Progress**: Data prep for Problem #1
1. Missing value treatment
2. One hot encoding the categorical variables (which leads to much higher number of variables)
3. Principal Component Analysis (to bring down the number of variables, while not losing information)
